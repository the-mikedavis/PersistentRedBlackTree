# Persistent Red Black Tree

A revision based persistent red black tree. All methods take a `Comparable` as
a parameter. This is useful for certain problems in Computational Geometry, in
which a sweep parameter like time or space can be used in creation of an
efficient lookup mechanism.

Based on the original implementation by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.
